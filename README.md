# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

### Tiny App Homepage
!["The user's homepage after they have logged in or created an account. Each url has a short ID. The edit button allows the user to change the long URL and the delete button allows users to remove urls they don't want anymore."](https://github.com/nathansmith-ux/tinyapp/blob/main/docs/test-email-homepage.png)

### Adding A Long URL

### Tiny URL Created From Long URL
